# **MiniMint**

## **Overview**
This project is a blockchain-based decentralized application (dApp) that showcases the use of Solidity for smart contracts, a Hardhat environment for development and testing, and a TypeScript + React frontend for user interaction. The dApp aims to [insert your project's purpose, e.g., "provide a marketplace for NFTs" or "enable secure note sharing on the blockchain"].

---

## **Features**
- **Smart Contract**: Written in Solidity, designed and deployed using Hardhat.
- **Frontend**: TypeScript-based React app for interacting with the blockchain.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Interaction with Ethereum or compatible networks using ethers.js.
- **Key Functionalities**:
  - [List major features, e.g., "Mint NFTs", "View transaction history", "Interact with contracts"].

---
