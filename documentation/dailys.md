# Documentation

The project is divided into five sprints spanning the period from November 25th to December 27th. Each sprint lasts for one week (Monday through Friday) and has a specific objective (e.g., Sprint 1 focuses on project planning and repository setup). A daily log will be maintained in this file to track progress.
