# Documentation

The project is divided into five sprints spanning the period from November 25th to December 27th. Each sprint lasts for one week (Monday through Friday) and has a specific objective (e.g., Sprint 1 focuses on project planning and repository setup). A daily log will be maintained in this file to track progress.

## Sprint 1: Project Planning and Repository Setup

This week was dedicated to planning and designing the layout for the repository and documentation. As the focus was on preparation, no daily logs were kept for this sprint.

## Sprint 2: Hardhat Environment, Writing, and Testing Contracts

> Monday

First day of development. As noted in the project plan, I spent the day setting up a Hardhat environment. I also added an ERC721 template to begin work on tomorrow. Additionally, I reflected on the project plan, as I have a meeting scheduled with the examiner tomorrow to discuss the possibility of adding complexity to the project.

Tomorrow, I will begin developing the main ERC721 contract that will allow all users to mint tokens. As a suggestion for added functionality, I plan to propose the inclusion of a Contract Factory to allow users to create their own collections, as well as an Auction contract to enable users to create auctions for their NFTs.

> Tuesday

Had the meeting with the examiner, and after his guidance decided to add a factory contract to the project plan. I think i will be able to fit this into the sprint im in now, as I feel I understand the logic behind it enough to implement it fairly easy. This will also add some more frontend work, that shouldnt be a problem. Today I have also added an ERC721 main contract, for general minting, aswell as made tests for it. I also updated the project plan, and sent it to the examinators.

Tomorrow I will write the factory contract, with belonging tests.
