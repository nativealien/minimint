# Documentation

The project is divided into five sprints spanning the period from November 25th to December 27th. Each sprint lasts for one week (Monday through Friday) and has a specific objective (e.g., Sprint 1 focuses on project planning and repository setup). A daily log will be maintained in this file to track progress.

## Sprint 1: Project Planning and Repository Setup

This week was dedicated to planning and designing the layout for the repository and documentation. As the focus was on preparation, no daily logs were kept for this sprint.

## Sprint 2: Hardhat Environment, Writing, and Testing Contracts

> Monday

First day of development. As noted in the project plan, I spent the day setting up a Hardhat environment. I also added an ERC721 template to begin work on tomorrow. Additionally, I reflected on the project plan, as I have a meeting scheduled with the examiner tomorrow to discuss the possibility of adding complexity to the project.

Tomorrow, I will begin developing the main ERC721 contract that will allow all users to mint tokens. As a suggestion for added functionality, I plan to propose the inclusion of a Contract Factory to allow users to create their own collections, as well as an Auction contract to enable users to create auctions for their NFTs.

> Tuesday

I had a productive meeting with the examiner, and based on their guidance, I decided to include a factory contract in the project plan. I feel confident that I can fit this into my current sprint, as I understand the logic behind it well enough to implement it without much difficulty. This addition will also require some extra frontend work, but I don't anticipate that being an issue.

Today, I successfully added an ERC721 main contract for general minting and wrote comprehensive tests for it. Additionally, I updated the project plan to reflect these changes and sent the revised version to the examiners.

Tomorrow, my focus will be on writing the factory contract and creating the corresponding tests.
